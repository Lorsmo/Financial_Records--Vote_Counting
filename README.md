# PyBank
In this project, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company using a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 


The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

```text

Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578

Greatest Decrease in Profits: Aug-2013  ($-2196167)

# PyDoll

In this project, the Python script helps a town to modernize its vote-counting process using a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, the final script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

```text
